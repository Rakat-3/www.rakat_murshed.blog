            <h2>Image Classification Using InceptionV3 on Intel Image Dataset</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This project focuses on the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a pre-trained InceptionV3 model for classifying images from the Intel Image Dataset. The primary goal is to leverage transfer learning to improve classification accuracy on a relatively small dataset.</p>

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p><strong>Dataset:</strong> The Intel Image Dataset consists of natural scene images classified into six categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street.</p>
            <p><strong>Model Architecture:</strong> The top layers of the pre-trained InceptionV3 model were removed, and custom fully connected layers were added to adapt the model to the specific classification task.</p>
            <p><strong>Training:</strong> Data augmentation techniques were applied to the training data, and the model was trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. The pre-trained layers were initially frozen, and later unfrozen for fine-tuning.</p>

            <h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
            <p>The model achieved a validation accuracy of 86.80%, demonstrating the efficacy of transfer learning in computer vision tasks. Challenges included data limitation and overfitting, which were mitigated through data augmentation and regularization techniques.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This project successfully implemented an image classification model using InceptionV3 on the Intel Image Dataset, achieving high accuracy. The use of transfer learning significantly reduced training time and improved performance.</p>
