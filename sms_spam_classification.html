            <h2>SMS Spam Classification</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The SMS Spam Classification project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "not spam" (ham). This report details the various stages of the project, from data cleaning and preprocessing to model building and deployment as a web application.</p>

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> The initial dataset contained multiple unnecessary columns, which were removed. Additionally, duplicate records were eliminated, resulting in a clean dataset of 5,169 SMS messages.</p>
            <p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Visualizations were created to explore the distribution of the number of characters, words, and sentences in the messages, revealing a class imbalance between "ham" and "spam" messages.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Text preprocessing involved converting text to lowercase, tokenization, removing special characters, stopwords, and punctuation, and stemming using the Porter Stemmer.</p>
            <p><strong>Model Building:</strong> Text vectorization was performed using TF-IDF, and various classification models were evaluated, with Multinomial Naive Bayes achieving an accuracy of 97.20%.</p>
            <p><strong>Deployment:</strong> The final model was deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input an SMS message and predict whether it is spam or not.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The SMS Spam Classification project successfully developed a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. The project also provided a user-friendly web application for real-time predictions.</p>
