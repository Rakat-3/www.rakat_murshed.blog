            <h2>Laptop Price Predictor</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the prices of laptops based on their specifications. The project includes feature engineering, model selection, and deployment using Streamlit to create an interactive web application.</p>

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p><strong>Data Collection:</strong> The dataset consists of various laptop specifications including brand, RAM, processor type, storage type, screen size, and price. These features were used to train the model.</p>
            <p><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Key features such as processor speed, SSD size, and GPU type were extracted and encoded for model training.</p>
            <p><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Multiple regression models were evaluated, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The best model was selected based on its performance metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).</p>
            <p><strong>Deployment:</strong> The final model was deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input laptop specifications and get real-time price predictions.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>The Random Forest model was selected as the best-performing model, achieving an R-squared score of 0.85 and a Mean Absolute Error of approximately $150.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This project successfully developed a machine learning model to predict laptop prices. The interactive web app provides a practical tool for estimating laptop prices based on their specifications.</p>
