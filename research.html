                <h3>Blind Helper Device</h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This research focuses on developing a device to assist blind individuals in navigating their surroundings. The device uses ultrasonic sound reflection systems to detect obstacles and an Android phone for object recognition. An AI system is integrated to suggest directions and the shortest paths. The device is controlled by an embedded system, and data is processed using vibration motors, where the speed variations in the motors represent processed data.</p>

                <h3>Optical Fiber Waveguide</h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This research explores the design and functionality of optical fibers as waveguides for light signals. The study delves into the materials and refractive index properties of silica-based optical fibers, including Photonic Crystal Fibers (PCFs). The aim is to design a hexagonal chemical sensor with high relative sensitivity across a wide wavelength range and reduce confinement loss while investigating sensitivity accuracy with fabrication tolerance.</p>
