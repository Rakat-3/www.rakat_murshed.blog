            <h2>X-Ray Image Classification to Identify Pneumonia</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that affects the lungs and can lead to severe complications if not treated promptly. This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically classify chest X-ray images into two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. The model is intended to assist in the early detection of pneumonia, potentially improving patient outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p><strong>Data Collection:</strong> The dataset consists of chest X-ray images categorized into two classes: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA.</p>
            <p><strong>Image Processing:</strong> The images were resized to 128x128 pixels and normalized. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, width and height shifts, and horizontal flips were applied to increase the diversity of the training data.</p>
            <p><strong>Model Architecture:</strong> The CNN model consists of three convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes, followed by max-pooling layers. The final layer uses a sigmoid activation function to output a probability score for the Pneumonia class.</p>
            <p><strong>Training Procedure:</strong> The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a binary cross-entropy loss function. A 3-fold cross-validation strategy was employed to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance across different data splits.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>The model achieved strong performance metrics, with the validation mean squared error (MSE) ranging from 0.06 to 0.07, indicating that the model generalized well to unseen data. The validation R-squared score ranged from 0.59 to 0.68, suggesting reasonable predictive power.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This project successfully developed a CNN-based model for classifying chest X-ray images into Normal and Pneumonia categories. The model demonstrated effective generalization, with potential for further improvements through deeper architectures and additional data preprocessing techniques.</p>
